							<h2>Organising 1Pixel Design Conf'23 - India's largest student led Design Conference</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">January 2023</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Convenor & Co-Founder </div>
							</div>
							<p>The 1Pixel Design Conference, held at the <strong>Indraprastha Institute of Information
								Technology, Delhi on 13 & 14 January,2023</strong>, was not just an event; it was the culmination of a spark of an idea
								that turned into a thriving design community. As one of the co-founders and conveners, I enjoyed being being part of an incredible journey filled with challenges,
								triumphs, and unforgettable experiences. In this blog, I will take you through the
								<strong>rollercoaster ride</strong> of organizing the 1Pixel Design Conference and share
								the lessons learned along the way.</p>
							<p><strong>Ideation</strong></p>
							<p>It all began with a small group of design enthusiasts, eager to bring back the culture of
								design and ignite conversations around it. With limited resources and a passionate team,
								we started with a vision of hosting a <strong>design meetup</strong>. Little did we know that our
								aspirations would soon grow into organizing a full-fledged design conference. The
								challenges were immense, from finding the <strong>right speakers</strong> and <strong>sponsors</strong> to securing venues
								and managing finances. Despite facing numerous rejections and doubts about our scale and
								reach, we remained determined to make our dream a reality.</p>
							<p><strong>The dream team</strong></p>
							<p>To navigate the complexities of organizing a design conference, we recognized the need
								for a diverse team with expertise in various areas. We reached out to individuals with
								backgrounds in graphic design, management, and 3D design to form our dream team. Each
								member brought <strong>unique skills and perspectives</strong>, making our collective efforts stronger
								and more effective. Together, we tackled every obstacle that came our way.</p>
								<img src="../img/blog/1px/team2.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
							<p><strong>Turning Challenges into Opportunities</strong></p>
							<p>As we delved deeper into the planning process, we encountered setbacks that tested our
								resilience. Our caterers backed out, merchandise partners failed to deliver as promised,
								and some speakers withdrew their participation. However, we refused to let these
								obstacles deter us. With our unwavering determination, we swiftly found new caterers,
								secured additional sponsors, and filled the gaps left by the departing speakers. We
								embraced the concept of <strong>"worst case scenario"</strong> (sometimes a little too much :) )planning, ensuring we
								were prepared for any unforeseen challenges.</p>
							<p><strong>Growth and Outreach</strong></p>
							<p>Promoting the conference and attracting participants was a crucial aspect of our journey.
								We devised a comprehensive social media strategy and actively reached out to colleges
								and design enthusiasts to create awareness and anticipation for the event. We
								established <strong>partnerships with other organizations</strong> and implemented a campus ambassador
								program to expand our reach. Despite initial difficulties, our marketing efforts gained
								traction, and registrations started pouring in.</p>
								<img src="../img/blog/1px/mascot.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
							<p><strong>Curating an Exceptional Speaker Lineup</strong></p>
							<p>One of our primary goals was to bring together a diverse group of influential speakers
								from different domains of design. We carefully curated a lineup that encompassed
								graphics, animation, user experience, and more. Notable speakers from prestigious
								organizations such as <strong>Samsung, Oppo, Wadhwani AI, Digitoonz and Microsoft</strong> joined us to share their insights and
								expertise. The commitment of these speakers further amplified the credibility and appeal
								of the conference.</p>
								<img src="../img/blog/1px/crowd.JPG" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
							<p><strong>Capacity Challenges</strong></p>
							<p>As registrations surged, we encountered a new (funny) challengeâ€” <strong>exceeding the venue's capacity.</strong>
								Initially concerned about low participation, we were suddenly faced with the task of
								managing an unexpectedly large audience. The situation required us to close
								registrations to ensure the comfort and safety of attendees. Although it was a
								bittersweet decision, it affirmed the success and popularity of the 1Pixel Design
								Conference.</p>
								<img src="../img/blog/1px/Banners.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
							<p><strong>The D-day</strong></p>
							<p>With meticulous planning and sleepless nights behind us, the conference finally arrived.
								We welcomed over <strong>200 participants from 25+ colleges</strong>, eagerly awaiting two power-packed
								days of inspiration and learning. The event featured a series of insightful sessions,
								workshops, a designathon, and mini events. Our speakers shared their <strong> expertise,
								providing valuable insights</strong> into the world of design. The conference concluded with an
								exciting workshop by renowned Art Attack host, and a prize distribution
								ceremony for the designathon.</p>
								<img src="../img/blog/1px/talk.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
							<p><strong>Reflection and Future Endeavors</strong></p>
							<p>The 1Pixel Design Conference was an incredible success, far surpassing our initial
								expectations. It provided a platform for designers to connect, learn, and showcase their
								talents. The event opened doors for <strong>networking, guidance, and future collaborations</strong>. Our
								team cherishes the memories and accomplishments, and we look forward to what lies ahead.
								Whether it's the 1Pixel Design Conference '24 or the 2Pixel Design Conference, our
								passion for design and community remains unwavering.</p>
							<p>Organizing the 1Pixel Design Conference was a remarkable journey filled with challenges,
								triumphs, and invaluable lessons. From humble beginnings to hosting a large-scale event,
								our team's dedication and resilience drove us forward. We proved that <strong>passion,
									perseverance, and a strong team</strong> can transform a simple idea into a thriving
								community. As we move forward, we are excited to continue nurturing the design culture
								and creating opportunities for designers to shine. Stay tuned for more remarkable design
								experiences on the horizon!</p>
								<img src="../img/blog/1px/team.jpg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
								<p>Apart from the resounding success of the conference, organizing the 1Pixel Design Conference provided me with personal growth and valuable experiences. It allowed me to delve deeper into self-discovery, broaden my network, establish meaningful connections, and learn to trust others. Throughout the journey, I realized that leadership doesn't always mean being involved in every decision. It involves empowering others and respecting their decision-making abilities. Moreover, I found a new family of passionate individuals who share my love for design. I forged strong bonds and formed friendships based on trust and mutual support. Ultimately, ensuring a positive outcome for everyone involved became the most important achievement for me.</p>
