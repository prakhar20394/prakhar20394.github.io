							<h2>Designing for Scale - My experience working at Government eMarketplace</h2>

							<p>During the summer of 2022, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at
								<strong> Government e-Marketplace (GeM) </strong> as a <strong>UX/UI Designer</strong>. GeM is a one-stop marketplace hosted
								by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, aimed at transforming the
								way government ministries, departments, and public sector undertakings procure goods and
								services. As part of the GeM Revamp project, I joined the organization to be part of the 
								redesign project of six of the most important modules across the buyer and seller
									platforms. This blog recounts my experience during this two-month
								internship and the valuable lessons I learned along the way.</p>
								<img src="../img/blog/GeM/Inside office.jpeg" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

							<p><strong>But what is Government e-Marketplace?</strong></p>
							<p>GeM serves as a pivotal marketplace connecting sellers, including resellers,
								manufacturers, small-scale and handicraft industries, with buyers such as central and
								state industries, public sector undertakings, and more. With over <strong>31 lakh products in
								approximately 11,000 categories</strong>, GeM has become one of the largest marketplaces
									in the country, facilitating trade worth over <strong> â‚¹3.5 lakh crores</strong> in a single financial
									year. The immense scale and impact of this platform intrigued me, as I knew
								I would be designing a solution used by millions of people across India.</p>
							<p><strong>Getting started with the project</strong></p>
							<p>My journey at GeM began by immersing myself in the context of the project. I familiarized
								myself with different departments, interacted with HR and department heads, and gained
								an understanding of the office environment. It was the first time I was working in some 
								experience, so it was a dreamlike to see it happen. <strong>Training sessions</strong> introduced me to the
								various sections of the product, its purpose, and the technical aspects involved. I had 
								seen my dad talking about the GeM portal, and how they use it in their organisation as 
								an OEM manufacturer to sell their products. Another friend's dad who worked in a central university mentioned 
								how her dad used it for procurement purposes. It was great to see the product in action 
								and seeing people around me being impacted by it.</p>
								<img src="../img/blog/GeM/web1.png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
								<p> Exploring the product using <strong> test accounts and developer platforms</strong> allowed me to grasp
								its intricacies and the diverse needs of its users. To understand more, I conducted <strong>heuristic testing</strong> through guided and unguided walkthroughs,
								employing tools like the <strong>Lighthouse Accessibility Testing tool.</strong></p>
								
							<p><strong>Understanding User Challenges</strong></p>
							<p>To revamp the user experience effectively, it was essential to comprehend the <strong>pain points</strong>
								and <strong>expectations</strong> of the users. Through interactions with the customer care team and
								engagement with external and internal stakeholders, we compiled a list of common
							<strong>problems and frequently asked questions</strong> for each module. These challenges were graded
								based on priority, forming our key performance indicators for the project. Subsequently,
								we <strong>collaborated with technical teams</strong> and <strong>module managers</strong> of each concerned module to
								understand the user flow in detail. They provided us with comprehensive insights,
								demonstrated the testing sandbox, and addressed our queries. We also noted any missing
								features, compliance with government guidelines, and changes needed based on legal
								requirements.</p>
							<p><strong>Mapping the User Journey</strong></p>
							<p>Once we gathered all the information, we <strong>documented the user journey</strong> through journey maps
								on <strong>FigJam</strong>. This high-level visualization allowed us to <strong>identify pain points</strong>,
								redundancies, and areas for improvement. Additionally, we reviewed the existing
								product's screen designs and added comments wherever we had doubts or suggested changes.
								The entire user flow was shared with the product and engineering team of the respective
								module for <strong>validation and feedback</strong>. </p>
								<img src="../img/blog/GeM/userflow-1.png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
								<p>As GeM was continuously developing, consolidating
								the entire flow from scratch was time-consuming but provided us with an in-depth
								understanding of the product.</p>
							<p><strong>Creating a seamless experience</strong></p>
							<p>With validated user flows, we began <strong>brainstorming and creating wireframes</strong> as a team.
								Low-fidelity prototypes were developed by <strong>hand-drawing key screens</strong>, enabling us to
								structure the pages effectively. Multiple iterations and discussions ensued until we
								arrived at a refined wireframe. Drawing inspiration from existing design guidelines, we
								crafted the screens, focusing on consistency, modularity, and customization. After
								internal reviews, we presented the finalized designs to the heads, including CEOs and
								Secretaries, for their input.</p>
								<img src="../img/blog/GeM/screen1.png" alt="Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
							<p><strong>Making the Design Guidelines</strong></p>
							<p>Towards the end of my internship, I was entrusted, along with another designer, with the
								task of creating the <strong>comprehensive design guide</strong> for the GeM portal. This provided an opportunity to delve deeper into design principles, web design best
								practices, and create a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for the portal's design. The design guide
								facilitated faster design and development of the modules, prioritizing UX improvements
								over visual aspects.</p>

							<p><strong>What I learnt</strong></p>
							<p>My internship at GeM was a significant learning experience, exposing me to the challenges
								of <strong>designing for a large-scale product</strong>. The diversity of users, complex use cases, and
								adherence to government guidelines required a comprehensive approach to design. I honed
								my skills in <strong>Figma</strong>, particularly in using <strong>components</strong>, which proved invaluable during the
								creation of the design guidelines. I developed the ability to <strong>lead discussions, justify
								design decisions</strong>, and differentiate between good and bad designs. Embracing minimalism
								and simplicity, I focused on creating experiences that were <strong>user-friendly and
								developer-friendly.</strong></p>

							<p>My internship at Government e-Marketplace was a rewarding experience that allowed me to
								contribute to the transformation of a <strong>major e-commerce platform</strong>. Designing for millions
								of users and addressing complex user challenges taught me invaluable lessons about <strong>user
								experience design at scale</strong>. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked alongside
								talented professionals and to have made a positive impact on the GeM Revamp project. It
								was a summer well-spent, where I acquired new skills, expanded my knowledge, and paved
								the way for a promising future in UX/UI design.</p>
