                Starting on a research project involving the
                <strong>Nao V6 robot</strong>
                was an memorable experience that allowed us to delve into the
                world of human-robot interactions. Under the guidance of Dr.
                Grace Edens and as part of the
                <strong>PAIZ project</strong>
                in collaboration with the
                <strong>University of Oulu, Finland</strong>, we had the
                opportunity to work with this NAO V6 robot. This blog captures
                our journey, and sessions we conducted at a government school
                in Delhi, and highlighting our exploration of the Nao V6
                robot, the aspects that captivated us, and those that left us
                wanting more.

                <strong>Reading IDC Conference</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                To gain a comprehensive understanding of the current research
                landscape, we began by immersing ourselves in the papers
                published in the
                <strong>Interaction Design and Children (IDC) conference </strong>. Through literature review, we
                familiarized ourselves with
                the prevailing research questions, methods, findings, and
                implications in the field of children and robot interactions.
                This foundational knowledge not only shaped our project but
                also fueled our curiosity to explore uncharted territories.

              <p>
                <strong>Selecting the Nao V6 Robot</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                After thorough research and evaluation, we made an informed
                decision to move forward with the Nao V6 robot. Despite its
                limited documentation, this robot stood out due to its wide
                array of built-in features and coding capabilities. Its
                frequent usage in academic research further validated our
                choice. While there were a few disappointments associated with
                the lack of comprehensive documentation, the potential for
                exploration and research outweighed these concerns.

              <p>
                <strong> Choosing the research Questions</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                while reading through the research papers, we realised that
                most of the papers focused on observing and understanding how
                the children-robot interactions work when in a particular
                scenario or a location, and how the children interact with the
                robot. We wanted to explore the other side of the coin, and
                understand how the children interaction with the robot changes
                when session is unsupervised and the children decide on what
                they want to do with the robot. We wanted to understand how
                the children interact with the robot when they are given the
                freedom to do so.

                <strong>Preparing for the Workshop</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                With anticipation running high, we meticulously prepared for
                the workshop at a government co-educational school in Ambedkar
                Nagar, Delhi. This workshop aimed to introduce children to
                robots and provide them with the freedom to explore their own
                ideas and needs in utilizing the Nao V6 robot. Given the
                disadvantaged backgrounds of the children, many of whom had
                never encountered robots or digital devices, this session held
                tremendous potential to spark their imagination and curiosity.
