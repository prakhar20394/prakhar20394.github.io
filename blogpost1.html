            <h2> Google Drive Me Crazy</h2>
            <p> Ah yes, Google Drive. Whenever I think about it, I can hear
              the menacing laugh of the Google Drive‚Äôs
              front-end designers and developers inside my head. Never have I
              ever been able to look at Google Drive and
              say
              ‚Äúhmm this is such a user friendly application!‚Äù. You can see
              that I am already upset as I am talking about
              it.
            </p>
            <p> I feel like I can try to solve this problem. All my college
              design courses in the past have taught me
              problem solving and Design Thinking as a problem solving
              strategy. </p>
            <p> The design course for my current semester, Designing
              Interactive Systems, is providing me with an
              opportunity to try to rectify this problem,
              and maybe feel like what it would be like to design a Google
              product.: ) </p>

              <h2>Project Plan</h2>
              <p> Based on our limited knowledge and experience, we started
                our Project by devising a plan for the next 5
                months. </p>
              <p> With user-centered design as our guiding principle, we aimed
                to redesign the Google Drive interface in
                such a way that users would find it easy to use. As a result,
                we had a direction for the next few months
                and
                aligned ourselves to our end goal. </p>
              <p> For the best development of our timeline and how to execute
                our work, we made a Gantt chart... But we
                didn't stick to it... :(</p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wrRGc3o.png" />

              <h3>Literature Survey</h3>
              <p> There is considerable research in the area of cloud storage
                and space management, and research is
                conducted regularly in this area. Different academia research
                in this aspect through different modes and
                research ideologies, from solving problems through technology
                to solving problems through user research,
                testing, and problem-solving through an interactive, dynamic
                design. The solution to the problem depends
                on
                the perceptions and ideas of different schools of thought.
              </p>
              <p> In some papers, cloud storage is discussed from a technical
                perspective (Sussenguth, 1963), while in
                others, the user interface is discussed from a user-friendly
                and attractive perspective (Borysiewicz, A. &
                Netguru, 2021), online data visualisation is important for
                increasing the use of cloud storage (Tanahashi
                et
                al., 2010) and research is underway to identify the methods
                for testing and evaluating the ease of use
                process (Hui & See, 2015; Truong, 2017). </p>

                </li>
                <p class="sublist-text"> Research has shown that data
                  retrieval and searching can be simplified by
                  implementing tree structures to store data, essentially
                  reducing the search time by O(log N)
                  (Sussenguth,
                  1963). </p>

                  <h5>Tests and Feedback</h5>
                </li>
                <p class="sublist-text"> The use of pilot studies for
                  conducting user studies has also been discussed in
                  other studies, which provide evaluators with the
                  opportunity to practice data collection and determine
                  potential problems while testing the protocol and the
                  instruments necessary to make key predictions.

                <li>
                  <h5>Knowledge of Design</h5>
                </li>
                <p class="sublist-text"> (Hui & See, 2015) discusses how
                  different cloud storage services are used and how
                  Customisable UI could increase ease of use. In order to
                  eliminate the misconception of
                  "One-size-fits-all"
                  theory, it discusses the inability of file storage
                  websites to provide an enhanced user experience and
                  the
                  need for customizable UI. </p>

                </li>
                <p class="sublist-text"> Researchers have found that online
                  visualisation services have been increasing in
                  conjunction with growing cloud storage by casual users
                  (Tanahashi et al., 2010). According to Tanahashi
                  et
                  al., visualisation of data stored in cloud storage is
                  important. It was suggested that casual users
                  should
                  have access to an interactive interface that uses cluster
                  searches and suggestive visualisations to
                  improve their experience. </p>

                </li>
                <p class="sublist-text"> Similarly, there is a blog
                  discussing the need to redesign the Drive and
                  reimagine
                  the functionalities of a typical user (Borysiewicz, A. &
                  Netguru, 2021). 61% of the users found search
                  to
                  be problematic, while 45.9% of people felt that sharing
                  files was an area of concern, while at the same
                  time, 36% of people felt that organising files was
                  unsatisfactory. </p>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p> These studies clarified our problem statement and supported
                our research objectives, as well as
                providing
                us with information about current academic research and the
                perspectives of various academics on the
                problem
                sphere we are involved with. They served as a foundation for
                further investigation and understanding of
                the
                issues at hand, as well as potential solutions. </p>

              <h3>Requirement Gathering</h3>
              <p> As a result of technological advancements, remote networking
                and collaboration are becoming more common.
                People from all over the world are gathering to work on a wide
                range of projects. Across all age groups,
                students are among the most enthusiastic cloud computing
                users. </p>
              <p> While the services are popular and valued, as evidenced by
                the large number of monthly active users, the
                Google Drive interface has a few flaws that detract from the
                end user's overall experience. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="heuristic-evaluation">
              <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
              <p> The first step in determining what was wrong with Google
                Drive was to use it. *Internal screaming* We
                decided to conduct cognitive walkthroughs in order to conduct
                heuristic analysis of Google Drive's
                existing
                services. I sat down and went over the basic task flows,
                noting down any link breaks or issues. </p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bTfzQL4.png" />
              <p> Heuristic evaluation is a process in which evaluators or
                experts use rules of thumb to assess the
                usability of an interface through independent walkthroughs,
                allowing the team to improve the product's
                usability from the start. </p>
              <p> It was difficult to determine the next steps in some areas,
                and the number of clicks could be reduced in
                others. The homepage was a mess, as it was nearly unusable,
                with the majority of it empty and no
                dashboard,
                which is not what one would expect from a Storage drive. </p>
              <p> In the heuristic evaluation, guided walkthroughs were used
                to highlight the good and bad aspects of the
                interface. Conducting a thorough analysis of the problem was
                the first step toward developing an online
                storage management solution. The heuristic evaluation can be
                found <a href="shorturl.at/ikADZ">here</a>.
              </p>
              <p> We tallied the results and made a note of them so that we
                could deal with them properly when the time
                came. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="survey">
              <h3>Survey</h3>
              <p> The next step was to distribute assessment survey forms once
                a basic understanding of the issues had
                been
                established. Students between the ages of 17 and 24, who are
                among the most frequent users of the G-Suite
                environment, were the target audience for the survey
                assessment. </p>
              <p> The medium was Google Forms, and the forms were distributed
                through peer WhatsApp groups. The survey
                began
                with demographic questions such as profession, frequency of
                use, and purpose of use, followed by Likert
                scale-based questions to identify the problems users were
                having with filing, user interface, and search
                algorithms, and finally, they were asked to provide feedback
                on future features they would like to see and
                their thoughts on problems identified by the team. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="competitive-analysis">
              <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
              <p> For our project "Google Drive me Crazy," we conducted a
                competitive analysis to better understand our
                competitors and to identify our requirements. The study's main
                objectives were:
              <ul>
                <li>Determine the competition's main characteristics.</li>
                <li>Determine the competition's strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                <li>Determine where the existing solutions/technology have
                  flaws.</li>
                <li>Determine additional requirements for our website.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p> Each choice for the competitive analysis was made for a
                reason:
              <ul>
                <li>Indirect competitor: Windows File Explorer. This is a
                  very popular file management programme.</li>
                <li>After Google Drive, Dropbox has the second-largest user
                  base.</li>
                <li>Mega: It is thought to be a safer cloud storage option
                  than Google Drive.</li>
                <li>According to one of our sources, OneDrive is better than
                  Google Drive.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p> We assessed and documented our competitors' strengths and
                weaknesses in order to develop the
                requirements
                for our website solution. We would draw inspiration from the
                study's positive findings while avoiding
                incorporating the study's weaknesses into our solution. </p>
              <p> We wanted to avoid some negative aspects in our product,
                such as a cluttered landing page, hidden file
                information, recent tab inconsistencies, and sluggish search
                results. </p>
              <p> We wanted to incorporate some positive aspects such as a
                clean and minimalistic UI, reduced user clicks,
                storage visualisation, a useful landing page, and a separate

              <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
              <p> We established contact with those who filled out the survey
                form, gave consent to the Interview round,
                and
                took their interviews to identify their pain points, gather
                more qualitative data, and understand
                different
                scenarios where they face problems after we completed the
                survey and had the quantitative data to
                understand
                the depth of the problem. Within the same stakeholder group,
                ten people from India, Finland, the United
                Kingdom, and Kenya were interviewed in person or via Zoom call
                to gather relevant information, map
                scenarios, and understand different user personas. </p>
              <p> There were four subthemes to the questions. The first
                subtheme dealt with their demographics, the second
                with their Google Drive usage patterns, the third with their
                pain points and issues, and the fourth with
                the
                project, their needs, potential pitfalls, and technological
                limitations. The goal of the interviews was to
                bridge the gap between expectations and the final product,
                resulting in a significantly shorter turnaround
                time. Surveys were used to gather information on needs at all
                levels, from the broadest to the most
                specific
                (Super Importance of Conducting Stakeholder Interviews in UX.,
                n.d.). You can find all of the interviews
                mentioned in this document <a href="shorturl.at/hkuL3">here</a>.

              <h3>Persona and Scenario Mapping</h3>
              <p> In any design process, defining the personas is critical
                because it helps us understand for whom we are
                creating these products. The attributes of the users aid in
                the understanding of their psychology, which
                in
                turn aids in the determination of the features. </p>
              <p> We created two personas that were similar but distinct,
                allowing us to reach a broader range of users
                who
                would use our service. We created multiple personas because
                our service was not designed for a single type
                of user. </p>
              <p> We also created anti-users this time. Those who will not be
                using our service. The goal was to identify
                the types of users who are unlikely to change their habits or
                find comfort in the existing Google Drive,
                and
                who will most likely continue to use it. </p>
              <p> We created scenarios for them where they might be willing to
                use our product to complete a task once we
                had the two personas. The personas were given a set of tasks
                to complete in order to identify the
                walkthrough process, key features, and suggestions, among
                other things. </p>
              <p> This allowed us to identify the most important features that
                needed to be implemented first, as well as
                the features that are more likely to be used and should be
                prioritised. </p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YHRXQbV.png" /> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1oJG7Er.jpg" />

              <p> Freeplane was used to do the project's initial technical
                planning. It's a mind mapping programme that
                helped me create tree-structured plans. It gave me the ability
                to organise my planning and was extremely
                useful during the pre-development planning phase. </p>
              <p> After that, we used Google Sheets to make a planner the old
                fashioned way. I broke the goals down into
                small tasks that we could divide and work on in parallel. </p>

              <h3>Feedback</h3>
              <p> We are conducting usability testing through 3 main methods:
              </p>
              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h5>Cognitive Walkthroughs with Loop 11</h5>
                </li>
                <p class="sublist-text"> A cognitive walkthrough is a method
                  of evaluating a product's usability in a
                  structured manner. It would be conducted on Loop11
                  platform, as we learnt from our research reading and
                  evaluate the system. </p>
                <li>
                  <h5>System usability scale</h5>
                </li>
                <p class="sublist-text"> Existing Google Drive and our
                  product to be able to compare both the products on
                  a
                  more quantitative basis. </p>
                <li>
                  <h5>Structured Interview</h5>
                </li>
                <p class="sublist-text"> We will conduct structured
                  interviews and talk to different users for feedback on
                  our product and then side by side make changes. </p>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p> These 3 ways to gather feedback and usability testing were
                determined solely on the bases of a paper we
                referred to during our Paper presentation, where we were
                fortunate enough to find the right way we could
                assess our Redesigned service. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="future-goals">
              <h3>Future Goals</h3>
              <p> We aim to make this product available on Phones as well.
                With that we plan to add loss-less compression
                in
                our product, so that the same limited storage space could be
                used to store more content, and the unused/
                reserve/ archive content will be compressed. We also aim to
                add more features and interoperability between
                different Cloud storage providers. </p>
              <p> There are a lot of issues in the current model as well,
                which needs to be addressed, along with
                formulating a proper Term and Condition sheet and complete
                other legal formalities as we proceed to roll
                this out to general public. </p>
